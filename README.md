## Project Title:
**IndiGo Airline Referral Prediction**

## Project Summary:
In the dynamic and highly competitive airline industry, companies like IndiGo are continuously striving to enhance customer experience and build lasting loyalty. A critical component of this effort is understanding and predicting passenger referrals, which can significantly influence the airline's market position and reputation. This project focuses on developing a predictive model to identify which passengers are most likely to recommend IndiGo Airlines to others, thereby enhancing customer experience, targeting improvements, and strategic marketing efforts.

## Goal of the Project:
To develop a predictive model that can identify passengers who are most likely to recommend IndiGo Airlines, helping the airline improve customer experience, target specific service improvements, and refine marketing strategies.

## Process:
### Data Collection:
- Gathered passenger reviews from 2006 to 2019.
- The dataset includes various aspects of the travel experience, such as comfort, service quality, and overall value.

### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
- Handled missing values, treated outliers, performed target encoding, and executed feature engineering.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualized data using graphs and charts to uncover patterns and trends.

### Data Splitting:
- Split the data into training and testing sets for model building.

### Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning:
- Employed classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

### Evaluation Metrics:
- Focused on Recall, Accuracy, and ROC AUC to evaluate the model.

## Details of the Features:
- **Comfort**: Ratings and reviews about the comfort level of flights.
- **Service Quality**: Customer feedback on in-flight and ground service.
- **Overall Value**: Perceived value for money.
- **Flight Experience**: Specific aspects of the flight experience like timeliness, cleanliness, and staff behavior.
- **Referral Likelihood**: Whether the passenger is likely to recommend the airline.

## Skills Used:
- **Programming**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit Learn.
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM.
- **Data Analysis**: Data Cleaning, EDA, Feature Engineering.

## Problem Statement:
The airline industry is highly competitive, and customer satisfaction and loyalty are key determinants of an airline’s success. This project aims to create a predictive model that precisely identifies passengers likely to advocate for the airline. This insight enables IndiGo to enhance customer service, tailor marketing and loyalty programs, improve brand reputation, and make informed business decisions, ultimately driving revenue growth.
